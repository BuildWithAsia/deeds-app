# Audio Files

Place your MP3 audio files in this folder to be served as static assets.

## Current Files Needed

## How to Add Audio Files

1. Place your MP3 file in this folder
2. Name it `diaspora-mix.mp3` (or update the path in `index.html`)

## File Size Recommendations

- Keep audio files under 10MB for faster loading
- Use compressed MP3 format (128-192 kbps is usually sufficient)
- Consider using shorter loops (30-60 seconds) that repeat
